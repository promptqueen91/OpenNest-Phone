📍 **Project Phase**: Definition & Planning

---

## 🔧 Summary
This week I officially started the **OpenNest Phone project**, my personal mission to build a working smartphone from scratch using open hardware and open-source software.

I've created the GitHub repository, set up my project phases, and started researching similar projects like PinePhone, PiPhone, and ZeroPhone.

## ✅ What I did this week
- Defined project structure and phases
- Created a shared component spreadsheet
- Explored 3 DIY phone projects for inspiration
- Started planning hardware configuration
- Set up this build log!

## 💭 Thoughts & Reflections
Starting this project feels empowering. It’s a big challenge, but learning how phones really work is something I’ve always wanted to understand. I'm approaching it one small step at a time — and documenting everything.

## ⏭️ Next Week's Goals
- Finalize hardware setup choice (Raspberry Pi 4?)
- Start ordering components
- Light testing: screen + power supply
