# 📱 OpenNest Phone

Welcome to my personal DIY smartphone journey!  
This is an open project where I aim to build a functional smartphone from scratch using modular components and a Linux-based operating system.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

Build a working smartphone from individual parts, learning hardware and software integration along the way.  
The final goal is to:
- Have a functional Linux/Android-based smartphone
- Write and document the entire process (build log + GitHub)
- Learn about embedded systems, electronics, and mobile OS
- Possibly re-use parts from an old iPhone
